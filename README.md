# mini-design-system

A lightweight, modular **React + TypeScript design system** focused on clean APIs, accessibility, reusability, and a smooth developer experience.  
Built with **Vite**, documented with **Storybook**, and tested with **Vitest**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

`mini-design-system` is a personal project where I explore UI component architecture, design tokens, and scalable patterns used in modern design systems.  
The goal is to build a **consistent, predictable UI foundation** that can be easily extended and integrated into real React applications.

This project showcases experience with:

-   Component-driven development
-   Accessibility & semantic HTML
-   API design for reusable UI components
-   Storybook-driven documentation
-   Automated testing & type-safe development
-   Front-end architecture & maintainability

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

Each component aims to have:

-   Predictable behavior
-   Strong TypeScript support
-   Snapshot or behavior-based tests
-   Confidence for scaling and refactoring

Testing ensures stability as more components are added.

## 📘 Why This Project Exists

This design system was created to:

-   Practice component architecture
-   Explore UI patterns found in modern design systems (MUI, Chakra, Polaris…)
-   Strengthen UX and accessibility engineering skills
-   Demonstrate front-end craftsmanship
-   Build a reusable foundation for future applications
